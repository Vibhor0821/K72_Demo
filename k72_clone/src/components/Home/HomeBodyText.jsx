      &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;K72 is an agency that builds brands <br />from every angle. Today, <br />tomorrow and years from now. We think <br />the best sparks fly when comfort zones <br />get left behind and friction infuses our <br />strategies, brands and communications <br />with real feeling. We’re transparent, <br />honest and say what we mean, and <br />when we believe in something, we’re all <br />in.
